Reggae in the bathroom\n
Reggae in the bedroom\n
Reggae everywhere\n
Reggae in jail, reggae in church\n
Everybody likes it\n
They tried to kill it\n
Many years ago\n
Killing the prophets of reggae\n
Destroying the prophets of reggae\n
But somebody said\n
To all the bald heads\n
Respect the rastaman\n
\'Cause he\'s the only one\n
Only one left in jah creation\n\n

Nobody can stop reggae [x3]\n

You can change the\n
Rhythm of playing reggae\n
But never ever\n
Change the message\n
Everytime I play it a Babylon\n

Killing the prophets of reggae\n
Killing the prophets of reggae\n

Let Rastas never die\n\n

When everything is going right\n
They forget about your presents\n
But when the tables turn upside down\n
They know that you\'re there\n
To my mom who taught me\n
That you\'re always there\n
I wrote this little\n
Song of praise\n
Now I\'m gonna sing\n\n

Jah live Jah children\n
Let Rastas never die\n\n

The Rastaman call him Jah\n
Some people call him Allah\n
English man call Him God\n
But he is one\n
We may have different names\n
To call him, but he cares\n
For everyone that\'s why I\n
Wrote this little song\n</item>

As a little boy I thought I knew\n
What I was doing, yeah man\n
But today here I am in jail\n\n

[Chorus:]\n
I\'m a prisoner [x3]\n\n

I looked all around me\n
But to see nothing\n
But four grey walls staring at me\n
The policeman said to me, son\n
They won\'t build no schools anymore\n
All they\'ll build will be prison, prison [x3]\n
\'Cause today, yeah\n\n

[Chorus:]\n
I am a prisoner [x3]\n
Dear lord\n

I asked the policeman and said\n
How much must I pay for my freedom?\n

All they\'ll build will be prison, prison [x4]\n

        <item>
            Every where in the world\n
People are fighting for freedom\n

Nobody knows what is wrong\n
The black man say it\'s the white man\n
The white man say it\'s the black man\n
Indians say it\'s the coloureds\n
Coloureds say it\'s everyone\n
Your mother didn\'t tell you the truth\n
Cause my father didn\'t tell me the truth\n
Nobody knows what is wrong\n
And what is right\n
How long is this gonna last\n
Cause we\'ve come so far so fast\n\n

When it started, you and I were not there so\n
Why don\'t we\n
Bury down apartheid\n
Fight down war and crime\n
Racial discrimination\n
Tribal discrimination\n\n

You and I were not there when it started\n
We don\'t know where it\'s coming from\n
And where it\'s going\n
So why don\'t we\n\n

I\' m not saying this\n
Because I\'m a coward\n
But I\'m thinking of the lives\n
That we lose everytime we fight\n
Killing innocent people\n
Women and children yeah\n
Who doesn\'t know about the good\n
Who doesn\'t know about the wars\n
Your mother didn\'t tell you the truth\n
Cause my father did not tell me the truth\n
Yeah\n\n

Black man say it\'s the white man\n
White man say it\'s the black man\n
Indians say it\'s the coloureds\n\n
Coloureds say it\'s everyone\n\n

We know where we come from\n
But we don\'t know where we\'re going\n
So why don\'t we\n\n

            Satan is working day and night\n
Doing the best he can\n
To destroy what Jah created\n
Trying by all means\n

Sitting by the door\n
One morning,\n
Looking at the children going to school man, then I thought about the ones in the street;\n
Moving up and down\n
No where to go,\n
No education,\n
No future.\n
Then I thought about their parents man, why do they suffer so much.\n
If they have parents why.
(if you really don\'t want no children why do you have them, why) [x2]\n\n

[Chorus]
We can fight and no one\'s hurt\n
We can stop children from the street. [x3]\n\n

It\'s a cold winter man, moving back cooler down khilo street man\n
His father is relaxing in the best bar in town asking them to fill his glass man.\n\n

His mother is kissing on another man.\n
If you really don\'t want no children, why do you have them.\n
If you can\'t care for them why ...\n\n

I\'ve been risking my life all these years\n
Protecting you from all the wrongs you did, man\n
I keep all this because of your promises\n
You promise me that you will die when I die\n
You promise that when trouble comes my way\n
You\'re gonna be there\n
But\'a when\'a trouble caz\'a nock\'a in\'a I and I door\n
You were not there to be found\n
But when the trouble comes and knocks on my door\n
You\'re not there to be found\n
But when the trouble comes and knocks on my door\n
You\'re not there to be found\n
The world is turning around\n
Yesterday becomes tomorrow\n
When lies are said to be the truth\n
And truth is said to be lies, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n

No truth in this world, no truth in this world\n\n

Like a preacher in church\n
Who preaches until tears run down his face\n
But when the sun goes down he is the hooligan\n
But when the sun goes down he is the witch\n
Now he is doin all this in the Creators name\n
Do you think this is the way God wants it to be?\n
The world is turning around\n
When today becomes tomorrow\n
When lies are said to be truth\n
The future becomes the past\n\n

No truth in this world, no truth in this world\n
No truth in this world, no truth in this world\n
No truth in this world, no truth in this world\n

How will I know if she loves me\n
You know she\'s the only one for me\n
How will I know if she loves me\n
Does she really care for me\n
I need her by my side\n
How will I know if she loves me\n
I wanna know oh baby yea\n
How will I know if she loves me [till fade]\n

We\'ve got the wind that blows every day,\n
We\'ve got the moon and the stars that gives us light every day.\n
We\'ve got the wind that blows every day,\n
We\'ve got the moon and the stars that gives us light in the dark.\n\n

We\'ve got life, we\'ve got clothes,\n
But at the corners of our minds we\'ve got a question.\n
And the question is, where do all these things come from?\n\n

This world is turning around but we don\'t know how it happens.\n
The world is turning around but we don\'t know how it happens.\n
Only God knows.\n\n

Let Jah be praised. [x6]\n\n

The world is turning around, but we don\'t know how it happens.\n
They say the world is turning around, but we don\'t know how it happens.\n
Only God knows.\n\n

We see the flowers and the trees,\n
They are growing out there where nobody cares.\n
They\'ve got life, they\'ve got energy,\n
But at the corners of our minds we\'ve got a question.\n
And the question is, where do all these things come from?\n
Ooh, nobody knows.\n\n

We are living in this world that\'s turning around, but we don\'t know how it happens.\n
The world is turning around but we don\'t know how...\n
Only God knows.\n\n

Let Jah be Praised [x12]\n
(Let him be praised, whoever you are, whatever you may do\n
Igziabeher, Negusa Negast praise the Lord.\n
I said praise.\n\n

The world is turning around, but we don\'t know how it happens.\n
The world is turning around, but we don\'t know how it happens.\n
Oh Jah, Jah...\n\n

We\'ve got the wind that blows every day...\n

Ministers of religion\n
Have visited me many times\n
To talk about it\n
They say to me\n
I gotta leave it I gotta leave it\n
It\'s a bad habit\n
For a man\n
But when I try to leave it\n
My friends keep telling me\n
I\'m a fool amongst fools\n\n

[Chorus:]\n
Now I\'m a slave, a slave\n
I\'m a slave\n
I\'m a liquor slave\n
I\'m a slave, a slave, slave\n
I\'m a slave\n
Just a liquor slave\n\n

I have lost my dignity\n
I had before trying\n
To please everybody\n
Some say to me\n
Yo yo\n
I look better when I\'m drunk\n
Some say no no no\n
I look bad you know\n
Sometimes I cry\n
I cry but my crying\n
Never helps me none\n\n

[Chorus:]\n
\'Cause now I am a slave, a slave\n
I\'m a slave\n
I\'m just a liquor slave\n
I am a slave, a prisoner\n
I\'m a slave\n
Just a liquor slave\n\n

Every night when I\'m\n
Coming back home\n
My wife gets worried\n
\'Cause she knows\n
Shes got double trouble\n
Coming home\n
Sometimes I cry\n
I cry lord I cry\n
But my crying\n
Never helps me\n\n

[Chorus: till fade]\n
Now I\'m a slave, a slave\n
I\'m a slave\n
I\'m a liquor slave\n
I\'m a slave, a slave, slave\n
I\'m a slave\n
Just a liquor slave\n\n
